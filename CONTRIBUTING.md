## Repo Map: Canonical vs Legacy Paths

This section exists specifically so you don't need private context to orient yourself. Read it before writing any new code.

### The canonical source tree

All production code lives in `tokenpak/` (the Python package). This is the source of truth.

### Where new code should land

| What you are adding | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| New compression algorithm | `tokenpak/compression/` |
| New provider adapter | `tokenpak/adapters/` |
| New routing rule | `tokenpak/routing/` |
| New CLI subcommand | `tokenpak/cli/` + register in `tokenpak/cli.py` |
| New proxy middleware | `tokenpak/proxy/` |
| New agent primitive | `tokenpak/agent/` or `tokenpak/agentic/` |
| New plugin | `tokenpak/plugins/` (see Plugin section below) |
| Framework integration (LangChain, etc.) | `packages/<framework>-tokenpak/` |
| Unit tests for `tokenpak/` code | `tokenpak/tests/` |
| Integration tests | `tests/` (repo root) |
| New public API symbol | `tokenpak/__init__.py` lazy map |

### Legacy and parallel paths — do not add new code here

The following paths exist for backward compatibility or are development artifacts. They look like source files but are **not** the canonical location for new work.

| Path | Status | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `proxy.py` (repo root) | **Runtime entry point** — do not replace | The server process that `tokenpak start` launches. It imports from `tokenpak.proxy.*`. It's being incrementally migrated into the modular tree; add new proxy features to `tokenpak/proxy/` instead. |
| `proxy.py.bak*` | **Development artifacts** — ignore | Working backups from active hot-patching sessions. Not part of the canonical tree. |
| `tokenpak/runtime/proxy.py` | **Compatibility shim** — do not add to | Bridges the old monolith symbols to their new modular homes. New proxy code goes in `tokenpak/proxy/`. |
| `tokenpak/_internal/` | **Private internals** — do not import | Implementation details used inside the package only. The public API is `tokenpak/__init__.py`. |
| `packages/core/` | **Parallel extraction tree** — see note | Mirrors parts of `tokenpak/` during incremental extraction. If you're unsure whether to touch this, ask in an issue first. |
| `tests.old/` | **Archived tests** — do not add to | Superseded by `tests/` (root) and `tokenpak/tests/`. |
| `_archive/` and `archive/` | **Archived files** — do not add to | Historical reference only. |
| `build/` and `dist/` | **Build artifacts** — do not edit | Auto-generated by `make build`. |

### The `proxy.py` situation

`proxy.py` at the repo root is the **live server entry point** — it's the process that runs when you call `tokenpak start`. It is large because it has accumulated inline functionality that has not yet been fully extracted into `tokenpak/proxy/`. The canonical pattern for new proxy work is:

1. Write new logic in `tokenpak/proxy/` (modular, importable, testable)
2. Have `proxy.py` import and use it (it already does this for most subsystems)
3. Do not add business logic directly into `proxy.py`

If you are patching `proxy.py` directly to test something locally, use a `.bak` suffix for your safety copy — but don't commit those.

### The `packages/` relationship

Each package in `packages/` is a **standalone, separately published PyPI package** that depends on `tokenpak` (the core). They are not part of the `tokenpak` package namespace. Each has its own versioning, tests, and `pyproject.toml`.

- Install and develop each independently: `cd packages/langchain-tokenpak && pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Tests live under each package: `packages/langchain-tokenpak/tests/`
- Do not add framework-specific imports to the core `tokenpak/` package

## Running Tests

```bash
# Quick CI/audit subset — <30 seconds, no live proxy or network required
pytest -m quick

# Fast (local package tests)
pytest packages/tokenpak-local/tests/ -q

# Full suite including slow tests
pytest packages/tokenpak-local/tests/ -q --slow

# With coverage
pytest --cov=tokenpak

# Run a specific file
pytest tests/test_compression.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_cache"

# Type check
python3 -m mypy tokenpak/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

### Test Marker Split

| Marker | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | Full suite | PRs, release gates |
| `quick` | Fast audit checks (<30s) | Pre-commit, CI fast gate, automated audits |
| `slow` | Long-running or network-dependent | Nightly CI only |
| `integration` | Requires live proxy or external services | Integration testing |
| `chaos` | Fault injection | Stability testing |

All tests must pass before submitting a PR.

## Code Style

We use:

- **Black** for formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **Type hints** on all public functions
- **Google-style docstrings** for classes and public methods

```bash
# Format
black tokenpak/

# Lint
ruff check tokenpak/

# Check formatting without writing
black --check .
```

---

## Submitting Changes

1. **Branch from `master`**: `git checkout -b fix/your-fix`

## Writing a Plugin

TokenPak supports custom compressor plugins that run before the built-in compaction pipeline.

### The Interface

Subclass `CompressorPlugin` from `tokenpak.plugins.base`:

```python
from tokenpak.plugins.base import CompressorPlugin

class MyPlugin(CompressorPlugin):
    name = "my_plugin"          # unique identifier — required

    def compress(self, text: str, context: dict) -> dict:
        """Transform text and return a result dict.

        Args:
            text:    The message content to compress.
            context: Runtime metadata — keys include ``mode``, ``input_tokens``,
                     ``request_id``.

        Returns:
            dict with at minimum ``{"text": str, "metadata": dict}``.
        """
        compressed = text.replace("verbose phrase", "short")
        return {
            "text": compressed,
            "metadata": {"plugin": self.name, "bytes_saved": len(text) - len(compressed)},
        }

    def priority(self) -> int:
        """Higher number runs first.  Default: 50."""
        return 75
```

The `compress()` method **must** return a dict with:
- `text` (str) — the (possibly modified) output text
- `metadata` (dict) — arbitrary info about what the plugin did

### Registering a Plugin

**Option 1 — Environment variable** (recommended for quick testing):

```bash
export TOKENPAK_PLUGINS=my_package.my_module.MyPlugin
```

Multiple plugins are comma-separated:

```bash
export TOKENPAK_PLUGINS=my_pkg.pluginA.PluginA,my_pkg.pluginB.PluginB
```

**Option 2 — Config file** (`tokenpak.config.json` in the working directory):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "my_package.my_module.MyPlugin"
  ]
}
```

Both sources are loaded at startup; env var plugins are registered first.

### Plugin Execution Order

Plugins with a **higher** `priority()` value run first.  The default priority is 50.  Built-in compaction runs after all plugins have completed.

### Error Handling

If a plugin raises an exception, TokenPak logs a warning and continues — the original message text is preserved and the next plugin (or built-in compactor) runs normally.

### Example Plugin

See [`tokenpak/plugins/examples/passthrough.py`](tokenpak/plugins/examples/passthrough.py) for a minimal no-op example you can use as a starting template.
