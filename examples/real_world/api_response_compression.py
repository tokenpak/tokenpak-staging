"""
API Response Compression
==========================
Compress third-party API responses before injecting them into LLM context.

Problem: API responses (REST, GraphQL) often include verbose metadata, nested objects,
         and human-readable descriptions that inflate token usage.
Solution: Extract relevant fields + compress prose fields before LLM injection.

Expected savings: varies by input; measure in your own workflow.
Setup: pip install tokenpak

    ## Problem

    The current TokenPak API does not support streaming compression. This is a significant
    limitation for use cases where data arrives incrementally, such as log processing,
    real-time monitoring, or streaming LLM outputs. Users who are processing large volumes
    of data currently must buffer the entire input before compression can begin, which
    creates high memory pressure and increases latency significantly.

    ## Proposed Solution

    Implement a streaming compression endpoint that accepts chunked transfer encoding
    and processes data as it arrives. The compression algorithm would need to be adapted
    to handle partial inputs gracefully, potentially using a sliding window approach or
    sentence-boundary detection to determine safe flush points.

    ## Expected Impact

    - Memory usage reduced for large documents
    - Latency for first compressed output reduced from O(n) to near-constant
    - Enables real-time use cases currently impossible with batch API

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    - [ ] Streaming endpoint at `/v1/compress/stream`
    - [ ] Compatible with HTTP chunked transfer encoding
    - [ ] Comparable compression quality vs batch mode
    - [ ] Documentation and examples
