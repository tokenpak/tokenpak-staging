"""
Database Query Results Compression
====================================
Compress large database result sets before passing to LLMs for analysis.

Problem: SQL query results (especially verbose JSON/text columns) can blow token budgets.
Solution: Compress result sets while preserving structure and key data.

Expected savings: varies by input; measure in your own workflow.
Setup: pip install tokenpak

            Customer churned in November 2024 after 18 months. Exit survey indicated that

            existing stack (they use Notion, Linear, and Slack heavily). The customer was
