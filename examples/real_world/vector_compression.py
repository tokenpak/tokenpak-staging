"""
Vector Store Context Compression
==================================
Compress retrieved document chunks before embedding or LLM injection.

Problem: RAG pipelines retrieve verbose chunks that inflate context windows.
Solution: Compress each chunk before injecting into the prompt, preserving semantics.

Expected savings: varies by input; measure in your own workflow.
Setup: pip install tokenpak

        The authentication system in this application is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
        When a user successfully logs in with their credentials, the server generates a signed JWT
        that contains the user's ID, roles, and an expiration timestamp. This token is returned to
        the client and should be stored securely. For subsequent requests, the client includes this
        token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme. The server validates the token's
        signature and expiry on each request. It is important to note that tokens should not be stored
        in localStorage due to XSS vulnerabilities. HttpOnly cookies are the recommended storage mechanism.

        Rate limiting is enforced at the API gateway level to protect backend services from overload.
        The current configuration allows 1000 requests per hour per API key for standard tier users,
        and 10000 requests per hour for enterprise tier users. When a client exceeds this limit, the
        API returns a 429 Too Many Requests response with a Retry-After header indicating when the
        client may retry. It is strongly recommended that all API clients implement exponential backoff
        with jitter to avoid thundering herd scenarios when rate limits are hit. The rate limit window
        resets on a rolling basis, not at a fixed time boundary.
