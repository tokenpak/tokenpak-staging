Basic Compression Example
=========================
Demonstrates TokenPak's HeuristicEngine for compressing text content.

Problem: LLM context windows are expensive. Verbose text wastes tokens.
Solution: HeuristicEngine compresses text while preserving meaning.

Expected compression: varies by input; measure in your own workflow.
Setup: pip install tokenpak

    The TokenPak library provides a comprehensive solution for managing token budgets
    in large language model applications. It includes multiple compression strategies,
    caching mechanisms, and telemetry tools. The library is designed to be easy to use
    while providing powerful functionality for advanced users. By compressing content,
    you can fit more information into fewer tokens, reducing API costs and improving
    response quality. The heuristic engine uses rule-based text processing to remove
    redundant content while preserving the most important information.

    Furthermore, it is worth noting that the library has been carefully engineered
    to handle edge cases gracefully. The compression algorithm preserves code blocks,
    headers, and list items — elements that tend to carry high informational value.
    Sentences that are deemed to be low-signal filler are removed automatically.
