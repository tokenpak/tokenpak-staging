"""Vault injection has a master switch, and it is OFF by default.

Injection admits retrieved vault content into a request before it reaches the
provider. Two controls that cover every other request path do **not** yet cover
injected content: the outbound DLP secret scan and the spend guard both evaluate
the body *before* injection runs. Until they evaluate the body that is actually
sent, enabling injection would ship vault content to providers unscanned and
untracked against cost caps.

The switch exists so that repairing injection — which is an *activation* of a
path that has never functioned, not a bug fix — cannot silently turn it on
everywhere at once.

These tests pin the default. A change to the default is a governance decision
and should have to break a test that says so.
