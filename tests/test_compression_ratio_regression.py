By intelligently compressing context windows and applying sophisticated tokenization strategies, TokenPak helps organizations minimize their LLM expenditures while maintaining semantic fidelity. The framework is production-ready and can handle enterprise-scale workloads.

The system operates through several key components that work together seamlessly. First, the capsule builder identifies verbose historical context blocks and applies deterministic compression. Compression targets paragraph-level text while preserving structure-bearing elements like headers and code blocks. This ensures that the compressed output remains readable and useful to the model.

Second, the tokenizer layer applies advanced tokenization strategies that account for subword boundaries and special tokens. This allows for more accurate token counting and better compression. Token budgets are managed dynamically based on usage patterns and configured thresholds.

Third, the routing system intelligently selects which model should process a given request based on token budget and latency requirements. This multi-tier approach allows for cost-effective processing without sacrificing quality or user experience.""".strip()

# ~5000 chars: verbose documentation
PAYLOAD_5000 = """TokenPak is a production-grade token compression and budget management framework for large language model applications. It provides transparent, deterministic compression of context blocks while maintaining semantic fidelity. The system is designed for zero-configuration deployment and can be integrated into existing LLM pipelines with minimal changes.

Architecture overview: The Capsule Builder is the core compression engine. It processes incoming request bodies and identifies eligible text blocks for compression. Compression is applied only to messages outside the "hot window" (the most recent N messages), ensuring that the current conversation context remains untouched. This design pattern prevents loss of critical recent context while aggressively compressing historical information that is less frequently referenced.

The compression algorithm operates at the paragraph level, preserving all structure-bearing elements like headers, code blocks, lists, and blockquotes. Prose paragraphs are deterministically compressed using whitespace normalization, sentence-aware truncation, and word-boundary truncation as fallback. Each compressed block is wrapped in a capsule envelope that includes metadata about the compression ratio and character deltas. This allows downstream systems to understand the compression characteristics without needing to re-analyze the data.

The Budgeter component tracks token usage across requests and maintains cumulative budgets for cost control. It supports both absolute budgets (maximum total tokens) and ratio-based budgets (maximum cost multiplier). When a request would exceed budget, the Budgeter can automatically trigger compression or routing to cheaper models. The Budgeter maintains historical statistics that can be used for capacity planning and cost forecasting.

The Router selects the optimal model for a given request based on token budget, latency requirements, and model capabilities. It maintains a registry of available models and their characteristics, allowing for intelligent routing decisions. The routing decision can be cached to reduce latency and computation overhead.

Features include automatic format detection, support for both JSON and plaintext payloads, integration with popular LLM providers, comprehensive logging and monitoring, and flexible configuration through environment variables or programmatic APIs.""".strip()
