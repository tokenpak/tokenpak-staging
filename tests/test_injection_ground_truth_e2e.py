"""Ground truth: does vault content reach the provider?

Every other test of vault injection asserts on an intermediate structure — that
a function is callable, that a stage populated a dict, that a value was written
somewhere. Three separate review rounds each verified one of those layers, and
each was correct, and the capability still did not work.

This suite asserts the only thing that actually matters: **the bytes the
upstream provider receives**. A mock upstream records the exact body it was
sent, and the assertions run against that recording.

Retrieval itself is stubbed — the vault index is not under test here. Everything
downstream of retrieval is real: adapter resolution, ``inject_system_context``,
the byte-splice restore path, and the live ``ProxyServer``. That is deliberate,
because that is precisely where the defects live.

If injection works, the marker appears in what the provider received. If it does
not, no amount of correct-looking intermediate state can hide it.
