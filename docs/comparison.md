# TokenPak vs. the Alternatives

**Last updated: 2026-04-08**

Buyers in this space are often evaluating several tools at once. This page gives an honest comparison so you can decide whether TokenPak is the right fit — or whether one of the alternatives serves you better.

> TokenPak is positioned as a **local-first compression proxy**. It runs on your machine, reduces the tokens you send upstream, and includes budget enforcement, audit logs, and multi-provider routing. It is not a multi-tenant SaaS observability platform. If that's what you need, read the honest weak spots section below.

## Where TokenPak Wins

### 1. Local-first / zero data leaving your machine

TokenPak runs as a local proxy process. Your prompts are compressed on your hardware before they reach any upstream API. Nothing goes through a third-party cloud intermediary — no Helicone servers, no SaaS dashboards, no vendor retention.

This matters for three reasons:
- **Privacy.** Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal) often cannot route prompts through a third-party cloud.
- **Latency.** No round-trip to a managed gateway. The proxy is on localhost; overhead is sub-millisecond.
- **Cost.** There is no per-token charge on the proxy tier. You pay the upstream provider only.

### 2. Deterministic compression with reproducible benchmarks

TokenPak's compression is deterministic: the same input produces the same compressed output every time. This means you can benchmark it in CI and trust the numbers. The [headline benchmark](BENCHMARKS.md) ships in the CI pipeline and runs on every commit — no black-box "up to 5×" marketing claims.

The compaction algorithm operates on the raw token stream before the request leaves your machine. It does not depend on semantic similarity lookups, embeddings, or an external service. It works offline.

### 3. Cost tracking wired to budget enforcement

TokenPak tracks cost and enforces it in the same code path. When a budget limit is hit, the proxy returns a `429 Budget Exceeded` response immediately — the upstream API is never called, so you are not charged. This is different from observability tools that track cost after the fact and alert you when you've already overspent.

## Honest Weak Spots

We don't compete everywhere. You should use a different tool if:

**Multi-tenant SaaS observability (LangSmith, Helicone, Langfuse are stronger here).**
If you need a hosted dashboard with team collaboration, trace search, LLM evals, and prompt version history accessible to a whole organization without running any infrastructure — TokenPak is not that. Langfuse and Helicone have invested heavily in this surface; LangSmith is tightly integrated with LangChain's evaluation tooling. If observability depth matters more than data residency, consider those tools.

**Dynamic routing breadth (LiteLLM, OpenRouter, Portkey are stronger here).**
TokenPak supports multi-provider routing, but if you need instant access to 200+ providers, per-request fallback chains, load balancing across multiple deployments, or a unified API that 100 teams can share — LiteLLM or Portkey are better fits. OpenRouter is the fastest way to experiment across many model providers with no infrastructure.

## Quick Decision Guide

| If you need… | Consider… |
|---|---|
| Token savings + zero data leaving your machine | **TokenPak** |
| LangChain tracing + evaluation | LangSmith |
| Maximum provider breadth (200+ models) | LiteLLM or Portkey |
| Instant access to many models, no infra | OpenRouter |
| Open-source observability with rich UI | Langfuse |
| Managed gateway with enterprise compliance | Helicone or Portkey |

## For Claude Code Users Specifically

**Last updated: 2026-04-09**

None of the alternatives in the table above were designed around Claude Code's consumption model. The table below maps TokenPak's Claude Code-specific features against each competitor.

| Feature | **TokenPak** | Helicone | LangSmith | LiteLLM | Portkey | Langfuse | OpenRouter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-mode profiles** (CLI / TUI / tmux / SDK / IDE / cron auto-detected) | ✅ 6 profiles, auto-detected via session headers | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Vault context injection post-cache-boundary** | ✅ Yes — injected before upstream call, respects `cache_control` boundary | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Multi-provider failover presenting as Anthropic-compatible** | ✅ Yes — Bedrock / Vertex / OpenAI behind a single `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | ⚠️ Routing only (changes base URL) | ❌ No | ⚠️ Routing only (changes SDK target) | ⚠️ Routing only (changes SDK target) | ❌ No | ⚠️ Routing only (changes SDK target) |
| **One-command Claude Code installer** (`tokenpak install --claude-code`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **`tokenpak doctor --claude-code` health check** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Inline savings reporting** (TUI footer / IDE header / SSE event) | ✅ Yes — 3 surfaces, per-turn | ❌ No (dashboard only) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Per-host config drift detection** | ✅ Yes — flags when profile or vault config diverges across hosts | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### Why These Three Points Matter Most

**1. The only proxy that ships profile auto-detection per Claude Code consumption mode.**
Claude Code runs in fundamentally different contexts — an interactive TUI session has different latency tolerances, compression needs, and output surfaces than a cron job or an IDE extension. TokenPak detects which mode is active via session headers and applies the right profile automatically. No other proxy in this list has a concept of Claude Code modes at all.

**2. Vault injection that respects Anthropic's prompt cache.**
TokenPak injects vault context (notes, docs, code snippets) into requests *before* they leave your machine, and it places that injection *after* the stable cache boundary. This means your system prompt — the part Anthropic caches — stays stable across turns, so you get full cache hit rates. A naive injection that prepends vault content to the system prompt invalidates the cache on every vault change. TokenPak's `cache_control`-aware injection (see the April 2026 hotfix) avoids this entirely.

**3. Cross-provider routing that presents as Anthropic-compatible.**
When TokenPak routes a request to AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex, it translates the request and response so Claude Code sees a standard Anthropic API response — same JSON shape, same streaming format, same error codes. Claude Code never knows it hit a different provider. Other routers (LiteLLM, Portkey, OpenRouter) require you to change your base URL *and* your model string, which breaks Claude Code's built-in model targeting.
