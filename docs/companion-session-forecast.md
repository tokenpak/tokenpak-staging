# Session forecasts in your terminal

The companion keeps a compact session display visible by default while you work.
It shows the session identity, guard state, forecast availability or estimated
remaining range, and spending or guard runway when space permits.

## Claude Code

```sh
tokenpak claude
```

An interactive companion launch adds the TokenPak native footer through its
temporary settings overlay, including when a custom status line is configured.
Your saved settings stay intact. Select `auto` to keep an existing user or
project status line instead:

```sh
tokenpak claude --status-surface=auto
```

Install `jq` for this adapter. Without it the footer says
`TokenPak | status unavailable`; startup and `tokenpak doctor --claude-code`
report the missing dependency. The reader does not inspect transcripts or
make provider requests.
The footer refreshes every two seconds, including while idle, using Claude's
[status line refresh timer](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline).

## Codex

`tokenpak codex` opens a small forecast pane below Codex by default. Inside tmux
it uses the current session; outside tmux it opens a private terminal session.
The pane closes when that companion exits. No extra flag is needed:

```sh
tokenpak codex
```

The pane requires `tmux`. If it is missing, the default launch explains the
dependency and continues without the footer. Explicit `--status-surface=tmux`
requires it and reports an error when unavailable. A private tmux server uses its own configuration;
existing servers, panes, and bindings are preserved. Detaching keeps the session
running and prints the command to reattach. This is a terminal pane, not an
extension of Codex's built-in `/statusline` fields.

The optional `auto` mode never starts a multiplexer. In an ordinary terminal it
prints the panel option and leaves Codex's own interface in place. Noninteractive
commands such as `codex exec`, JSON output, and install-only runs create no panel.

## Read or disable a display

```sh
tokenpak status --line --session YOUR_SESSION_ID
tokenpak status --full --session YOUR_SESSION_ID
tokenpak status --json --session YOUR_SESSION_ID
tokenpak codex --status-surface=off
tokenpak claude --status-surface=off
```

`TOKENPAK_STATUS_SURFACE=off` disables both adapters. Supported surface values
are `on` (default), `auto`, `native` (Claude), `tmux` (Codex), and `off`. An explicit
flag overrides the environment variable. Native arguments after
`--` are forwarded without interpretation.

Use the exact native session ID when reading from a separate terminal. A managed
companion binds its own session on startup, resume, and clear; it does not borrow
the newest session from another terminal. A session needs completed requests in
the local proxy's ledger before its economics can be shown. Starting a display
does not backfill earlier traffic or invent missing usage measurements.

## Read the estimates correctly

- `usage 24/25` means 24 of 25 completed requests have a complete provider
  token measurement. Requests include tool continuations and failed responses;
  this is not the number of user messages. A failed response with missing usage
  can leave full-session totals unavailable while successful requests still
  register. The full status view shows measured subtotals and failed-request
  counts separately. Subtotals do not establish total spend or guard runway.
- Forecasts keep model and effort histories separate. An explicit `xhigh`
  request stays in its own category, including when an older ledger writer
  preserved it only in the raw effort field. Missing effort remains `unknown`;
  it is never silently treated as `high` or `xhigh`. A model change, including
  one associated with a failed request, still makes a full-session forecast
  unavailable. A fresh homogeneous session can collect eligible history, but
  calibration requirements still apply before forecasts appear.
- `est` and `~` identify estimates. Remaining ranges carry their 50% interval
  label; the 90% ceiling appears when there is room.
- `guard limit` is the estimated number of turns before a configured constraint,
  not the number of turns needed to finish your task.
- `learning`, `no data`, and `unavailable` are real states. Subscription traffic
  can show `subscription` rather than a fabricated dollar bill.
- `stale` means the cached observation expired. Expired numbers are hidden.
- Narrow terminals show fewer complete fields, preserving guard information.
  The display makes no numeric savings claim and triggers no session switch.

One process per managed display refreshes the explicit session's local snapshot
about every two seconds. The shell adapters read a pre-rendered cache with a
ten-second expiry. Cache files are private, live under the companion's own run
directory, and contain bounded session metadata rather than request bodies.
The snapshot JSON preserves field sources, timestamps, routing mode, and the
original session-economics contract. The optional Pro daemon is not required.
