# Compression: How It Works

TokenPak provides explicit compression APIs and the `tokenpak compress` CLI.
The built-in default HTTP proxy does not invoke the legacy
`compact_request_body` helper. Request bodies are transformed only when a
calling integration explicitly invokes a compression path; Claude Code request
bodies remain byte-preserved.

---

## When the Legacy Helper Runs

`compact_request_body` runs only when application code calls it. For those
explicit calls, `TOKENPAK_COMPACT_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` supplies the minimum input
size (default in the balanced profile: **1,500 tokens**). Inputs below that
threshold are returned unchanged.

```
Explicit helper call
 │
 ├── input_tokens < threshold → unchanged
 │
 └── input_tokens ≥ threshold → compression pipeline
```

`TOKENPAK_COMPACT` and `compression.enabled` are compatibility-only settings:
they are parsed and exported, but neither the helper nor the default HTTP path
uses them as an on/off switch. Changing the threshold on `tokenpak serve` does
not wire the helper into that path.

## The Pipeline

### Stage 1: Dedup

Scans the message history for duplicate or near-duplicate turns. If the same content appears multiple times (common when context is repeatedly injected), duplicates after the first occurrence are removed.

```python
# Before
messages = [
 {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the code:\n<500 lines>"},
 {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll review it."},
 {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the code:\n<500 lines>"}, # ← duplicate
 {"role": "user", "content": "Now fix line 42."},
]

# After dedup
messages = [
 {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the code:\n<500 lines>"},
 {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll review it."},
 {"role": "user", "content": "Now fix line 42."},
]
```

---

### Stage 2: Segmentize

The segmentizer classifies message content into typed blocks:

| Segment type | Content | Compression strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | Fenced code blocks | Signature extraction |
| `markdown` | Headers, lists, prose | Sentence filtering |
| `json` | JSON objects/arrays | Schema + sampling |
| `tool_call` | Tool use / function calls | Keep as-is |
| `tool_result` | Tool outputs | Truncation |
| `system` | System prompt | Recipe-based |
| `text` | Plain prose | Token filtering |

Each segment carries metadata: estimated token count, language (for code), and priority score.

---

### Stage 3: Directives

Directives are declarative compression instructions attached to a recipe. Each directive targets a segment type and describes what to do.

Example directive (`recipes/oss/code-review.yaml`):

```yaml
directives:
 - type: code
 action: signature_only # keep function signatures, strip bodies
 language: [python, js, ts]
 preserve_docstrings: true

 - type: markdown
 action: keep_headers # strip body text, keep heading structure
 max_depth: 3

 - type: text
 action: filter_tokens
 ratio: 0.6 # keep top 60% by importance score
```

Built-in recipes live in `recipes/oss/`. Pro recipes add more aggressive options.

---

### Result

After the pipeline, the `PipelineResult` object contains:

```python
@dataclass
class PipelineResult:
 messages: List[Dict] # compressed messages (same format, fewer tokens)
 segments: List[Segment] # per-segment metadata
 tokens_raw: int # tokens before compression
 tokens_after: int # tokens after compression
 duration_ms: float # pipeline wall time
 stages_run: List[str] # which stages ran

 @property
 def savings_pct(self) -> float: ...
```

---

## Compression Modes

| Mode | `TOKENPAK_MODE` | Explicit-helper behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Hybrid** (default) | `hybrid` | Applies eligible helper stages after the threshold check |
| **Strict** | `strict` | Returns the body unchanged |
| **Aggressive** | `aggressive` | Allows more eligible helper stages after the threshold check |

These values do not activate compaction in the default HTTP proxy.

---

## Engines

### Heuristic engine (default)

Rule-based compression. Runs in <5ms, zero ML dependencies. Handles:

- Regex-based whitespace normalization
- Comment stripping (configurable per language)
- Boilerplate removal (common patterns: `# type: ignore`, `pylint: disable=...`)
- Markdown flattening

### LLMLingua engine (optional, Pro/advanced)

ML-powered token-level compression using the [LLMLingua-2](https://github.com/microsoft/LLMLingua) model. Achieves 2–20x compression with <5% quality loss (per Microsoft benchmarks).

Install:

```bash
pip install tokenpak[compression]
```

LLMLingua activates automatically when installed. It runs locally — no API calls.

---

## Custom Hooks

Add your own compression logic via the pipeline hook API:

```python
from tokenpak.agent.compression.pipeline import CompressionPipeline

def my_hook(messages):
 # Remove messages older than 10 turns
 return messages[-10:]

pipeline = CompressionPipeline()
pipeline.add_hook(my_hook)
result = pipeline.run(messages)
```

Hooks run after the standard stages in insertion order.

---

## Recipe Development

Recipes are YAML files in `recipes/oss/` that define directives for a specific use case.

Minimal recipe:

```yaml
# recipes/oss/my-recipe.yaml
name: my-recipe
version: "1.0"
description: Custom compression for my workflow

directives:
 - type: text
 action: filter_tokens
 ratio: 0.7

 - type: code
 action: signature_only
 language: [python]
```

Apply a recipe:

```bash
tokenpak template use my-recipe
```

See [Recipe Development](guides/recipes.md) for the full directive schema reference.

## Dry Run

Preview what compression would do without actually sending the request:

```bash
tokenpak compress myfile.txt
```

Output:

```
Input: 12,840 tokens
Output: 6,918 tokens
Saved: 5,922 tokens (46.1%)
Time: 8.4ms

Stages: dedup (0 removed) → segmentize (14 blocks) → directives (applied)
```

## Performance

Only explicit callers incur compression work. Benchmark the full calling
integration with representative inputs; default HTTP proxy latency does not
include a `compact_request_body` call.
