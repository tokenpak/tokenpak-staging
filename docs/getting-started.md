# Getting Started (Day 1 Quick Start)

Get TokenPak running in under 5 minutes.

> **Want the full journey?** This page covers Day 1 only. For Day 3 through Day 30 — savings reports, recipe customization, budgets, and production deployment — see the [full Onboarding Guide](onboarding.md).

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- An existing LLM client (Claude Code, OpenAI client, etc.)
- Your provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

---

## Install

=== "pip"
 ```bash
 pip install tokenpak
 ```

=== "From source"
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tokenpak/tokenpak
 cd tokenpak
 pip install -e .
 ```

=== "With optional extras"
 ```bash
 # Semantic/vector search
 pip install tokenpak[retrieval]

 # LLMLingua compression engine
 pip install tokenpak[compression]

 # Exact OpenAI-compatible token counts
 pip install tokenpak tiktoken
 ```

---

## Configure Your LLM Client (one-time wizard)

Run the setup wizard once after installing:

```bash
tokenpak setup
```

The wizard detects your installed LLM client and writes the proxy URL into the correct
config file automatically — no manual editing required.

- **Claude Code**: writes `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8766` into `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **OpenAI SDK**: prints the one-line export command
- **Google AI SDK**: prints the one-line export command

!!! tip "Non-interactive / CI"
 Run `tokenpak setup` and answer the prompts, or set the proxy URL manually using the instructions in the [manual alternative](#connect-your-llm-client-manual-alternative) section below.

The wizard never reads or writes API keys — only proxy URLs.

---

## Start the Proxy

```bash
tokenpak serve --port 8766
```

The proxy starts on `http://localhost:8766` and is ready to accept requests immediately.

!!! tip "Run in background"
 ```bash
 tokenpak serve --port 8766 &
 # Stop with:
 tokenpak stop
 ```

---

## Connect Your LLM Client (manual alternative)

If you prefer to configure your client manually instead of using `tokenpak setup`:

=== "Claude Code"
 Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
 ```json
 {
 "env": {
 "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8766"
 }
 }
 ```
 Or set in your shell config:
 ```bash
 export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8766
 ```

=== "OpenAI Python"
 ```python
 from openai import OpenAI

 client = OpenAI(
 base_url="http://localhost:8766/v1",
 api_key="your-key-here"
 )
 ```

=== "OpenAI CLI"
 ```bash
 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8766/v1
 ```

=== "Any HTTP client"
 Replace your provider base URL with `http://localhost:8766`.
 TokenPak auto-detects the provider from the `Authorization` header and routes accordingly.

Your credentials pass through unchanged. TokenPak never stores them.

---

## Verify It's Working

```bash
tokenpak status
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Proxy: running on :8766
✓ Compression: enabled (balanced mode)
✓ Cost tracking: active
✓ Session: 0 requests
```

Make a test request through your client, then:

```bash
tokenpak cost
# Requests today: 1 | Cost today: <your measured total>
# Run tokenpak savings after real traffic for receipt-backed savings.
```

---

## Index Your Vault (Optional, Zero Tokens)

If you work with a large codebase or notes vault, index it for instant semantic search:

```bash
tokenpak index ~/notes
tokenpak vault repair # Check index health and rebuild stale entries
```

This uses a local SQLite registry — no LLM calls, no cost.

---

## Auto-Calibration (Recommended)

Let TokenPak calibrate optimal parallelism for your hardware:

```bash
tokenpak calibrate ~/notes --max-workers 8 --rounds 2
```

This runs once and saves a profile to `~/.tokenpak/calibration.json`. Future indexing runs use it automatically.

---

## Set a Budget (Optional)

Protect yourself from runaway costs:

```bash
tokenpak budget set --monthly 50 # $50/month limit
tokenpak budget alert --at 80% # warn at 80%
```
