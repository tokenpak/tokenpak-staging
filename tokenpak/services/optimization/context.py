"""Per-request context passed through the optimization pipeline.

Mirrors the ``OptimizationContext`` shape proposed in the optimization-layer
design (Phase 3 Component B). The fields are kept loosely typed (``Any``
where the upstream contract hasn't landed in this workspace) so the context
can be constructed without depending on contracts that aren't imported here.
