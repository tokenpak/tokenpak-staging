"""Generate and install AGENTS.md for durable TokenPak behavior in Codex.

AGENTS.md is Codex's mechanism for persistent behavioral guidance.  It's
loaded before each session and merged from global ($CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md) to
project (<repo>/AGENTS.md) scope.

The companion installs a global AGENTS.md with rules for:
- When to load capsules
- How to use the journal
- Budget-aware behavior
- Context bloat avoidance

# TokenPak Companion

You have access to TokenPak companion tools via MCP. These tools help manage
cost, context, and session continuity.

## Available MCP tools

- **estimate_tokens** — Check token count before including large content.
- **check_budget** — Query remaining cost budget for this session and today.
- **load_capsule** — Load compressed context from a prior session.
- **prune_context** — Compress verbose tool output to reduce token usage.
- **journal_read** — Read notes from past sessions.
- **journal_write** — Save important decisions or milestones.
- **session_info** — Get companion status and configuration.

## When to use tools

- **Before reading large files**: call `estimate_tokens` with the file path
  to decide if the cost is worth it.
- **Before multi-step tasks**: call `check_budget` to see if there is
  headroom for the full task.
- **When resuming prior work**: call `load_capsule` to recall context from
  the previous session rather than re-reading everything.
- **After verbose tool output**: consider calling `prune_context` if the
  output exceeds ~2000 tokens and you only need the summary.
- **When making architectural decisions**: call `journal_write` to record
  the decision and rationale for future sessions.

## When NOT to load capsules

Do not load capsules automatically on every session start.  Only load when:
- The user references prior work or a previous session.
- You need context that would otherwise require re-reading many files.
- The user explicitly asks to resume.

## Budget awareness

- If `check_budget` shows less than 20% remaining, warn the user before
  starting expensive operations (large file reads, multi-step refactors).
- If budget is exceeded, the UserPromptSubmit hook will block the request.
  Do not attempt to work around budget blocks.

## Context hygiene

- Prefer targeted file reads over whole-file reads.
- Do not include full file contents in journal entries — summarize.
- When tool output is large, prune it before reasoning over it.
- Keep journal entries concise: one decision per entry, include rationale.

## Verification

- Verify before claiming completion. Run tests, check builds, confirm the
  change actually works.
- Do not claim a task is done based solely on writing code — confirm it
  compiles, passes tests, or visibly works.
