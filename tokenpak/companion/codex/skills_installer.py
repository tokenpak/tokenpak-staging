"""Install TokenPak skills into the Codex skills directory.

Skills are copied from the bundled ``skills/`` directory to the user
skill-discovery path Codex actually scans: ``$HOME/.agents/skills``
(spec: https://developers.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-skills). The set
of skills is discovered at runtime by globbing for ``SKILL.md`` — no
hardcoded enumeration (see ``feedback_always_dynamic.md``).  Uninstall
sweeps both the canonical path AND the pre-L3 legacy ``~/.codex/skills``
location so users upgrading from earlier installs don't leave orphans.

Install is hardened against concurrent launcher starts (two ``tokenpak
codex`` invocations racing on the same target directory): the operation
is serialized with a TokenPak-owned interprocess lock, each skill is
staged in full inside a unique temp sibling and then published with fast
renames — so a reader (Codex scanning the directory) never sees a
half-copied skill and only ever sees an installed skill absent for the
span of a single rename.

The prior copy of a replaced skill is retained as a timestamped generation
rather than deleted the instant it is superseded: ``os.replace`` only
rebinds a name, so a reader that opened the old directory before the swap
still holds that inode, and deleting it immediately would empty the inode
mid-``readdir``.  Retired generations and stale stage/backup leftovers from
a crashed prior install are reclaimed on a later launch once older than
:data:`_RECLAIM_MIN_AGE_S` — past any live enumeration — so cleanup never
races a reader and old generations are never retained indefinitely.
