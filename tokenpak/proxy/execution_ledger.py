"""Durable write-ahead ledger for in-flight upstream (provider) calls.

Problem this closes
--------------------
``upstream_retry.py`` already tags a request with a ``tip_plan_id`` and, when
the *same process* observes an upstream failure, returns a structured
``TIPError``/``recovery_status`` payload instead of a bare error. That
machinery is entirely in-memory: it only runs code that is still executing.
If the TokenPak proxy process itself dies mid-request — OOM-kill, a deploy,
``systemctl restart``, any ordinary operational event for a long-running
service — none of that in-process handling ever runs. The client just sees
its connection reset, with no ledger anywhere recording that a plan was ever
in flight, so a fresh process has no way to tell "restart interrupted a live
request" apart from "nothing was happening."

This module adds exactly one durable fact: a row, keyed by ``tip_plan_id``,
that is written *before* the upstream call is dispatched (write-ahead) and
updated once the outcome is known. On process startup, before the listener
accepts a single connection, :func:`recover_orphaned_plans` sweeps rows still
marked ``in_flight`` — since this process has not yet served any request,
every such row necessarily belongs to a process that died mid-call — and
marks them ``failed`` with ``failure_reason="proxy_restart_detected"``. If
the client later retries with the same ``tip_plan_id``,
:func:`check_restart_recovered_failure` lets the request handler answer with
an explicit terminal-failure signal (the same
``build_terminal_recovery_payload`` shape ``upstream_retry.py`` already uses)
instead of silently attempting a stale, possibly half-consumed request.

What this deliberately does NOT do
-----------------------------------
Full transparent replay of a provider call that was mid-stream when the
proxy died is out of scope here — resuming a partially-streamed completion
mid-token is not something this module attempts, and it is not safe to fake.
This ledger's job stops at *detecting* the restart-interrupted plan and
*signaling* it cleanly; it never re-issues the original upstream call.

This is also intentionally narrower than a full exactly-once/durable-resume
system: there is no multi-stage intent/sent/acked/terminal/receipt state
machine here, no idempotency-key derivation, and no resume-disposition enum.
Only the minimum shape needed to turn "raw connection reset" into "an
explicit, ledger-backed failure signal" is implemented:

- ``tip_plan_id``            — the same identifier ``upstream_retry.py`` uses.
- ``request_hash``           — sha256 of the outbound request bytes (the same
                                formula an adjacent durable-resume proposal
                                defines for its own, broader ``request_hash``
                                field: sha256 of the exact provider-bound
                                bytes). Used here only for diagnostic/identity
                                purposes, not as part of an idempotency key.
- ``status``                 — ``in_flight`` / ``completed`` / ``failed``.
- ``failure_reason``         — free-form short token; restart-detected rows
                                use ``proxy_restart_detected``.

DB layout follows the ``spend_guard.db`` convention (see
``proxy/spend_guard/pending.py``): one SQLite file under the TokenPak home
directory, lazy ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``, a fresh ``sqlite3.connect``
per call (no pool — this is a low-volume write-ahead log, not a hot
telemetry path), WAL + busy_timeout so a concurrent reader/writer never
raises "database is locked" into the request path.

Fails open, always. Every public function swallows ``sqlite3.Error`` and
``OSError`` and returns a harmless default — a ledger outage must never turn
into a proxy outage. Disable entirely with
``TOKENPAK_EXECUTION_LEDGER_ENABLED=0``.
