"""Feature-flagged credential injection using the creds router.

Default **off**. Flip ``TOKENPAK_CREDS_ROUTER_ENABLED=1`` to route
request credentials through :mod:`tokenpak.creds.router` + per-provider
``resolve_secret`` instead of the hardcoded Codex-auth-file path.

Design goals:

* **Fail-open.** Any router error (no route, ambiguous, secret
  unresolvable, exception) falls back to the caller's existing flow.
  The proxy must never drop a working request because of this module.
* **No cache.** Providers' ``resolve()`` functions already read fresh
  from their owning tool's auth file. Caching here would re-introduce
  the staleness class of bug we built the router to surface.
* **Explicit inputs.** Destination host + caller identity come from the
  request; callers can add ``X-Tokenpak-Credential`` for explicit-tag
  routing or ``X-Tokenpak-Caller`` to identify themselves to rules.

Return contract: ``maybe_inject()`` returns True iff the caller should
**skip** the old hardcoded Codex injection — i.e. we've injected a
router-chosen credential and the caller is done. Otherwise the caller
continues with its existing logic unchanged.
