# TokenPak Dashboard — Motion Choreography Testing Guide

## Overview
This document serves as a QA checklist for validating the motion choreography system. All animations should feel smooth, responsive, and intentional.

**Environment**: Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktop & mobile
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes per test suite
**Success Criteria**: Smooth 60fps animations, <500ms perceived latency

---

## 1. Number Value Transitions

### Test 1.1: KPI Number Counting
1. Navigate to any dashboard page with KPI cards (Cost, Units, etc.)
2. Change a filter (date, region, etc.)
3. **Verify**: Numbers smoothly count from old → new value
   - ✅ Animation duration: 300-500ms (should feel snappy, not instant)
   - ✅ Easing: Fast start, gentle end (cubic-bezier ease-out)
   - ✅ No jarring jumps or flashing
4. **Check mobile**: Animations complete slightly faster on mobile

### Test 1.2: Format Handling
1. Check KPIs with different formats:
   - Currency: $1,247 → $892 (with $ and comma formatting)
   - Percentage: 42.5% → 58.3%
   - Large numbers: 1,234,567 → 987,654
2. **Verify**: All formats animate smoothly without formatting delays

---

## 2. Chart Transitions

### Test 2.1: Filter Change → Chart Fade
1. Open a dashboard with charts (Cost over time, distribution, etc.)
2. Change a filter that affects the chart
3. **Verify sequence**:
   - ✅ Chart fades out (150ms, smooth)
   - ✅ Brief loading state (skeleton pulse)
   - ✅ Chart fades in (200ms, smooth)
   - ✅ Total perceived time: <500ms
4. No layout shift or reflow (chart container stays same size)

### Test 2.2: Hover on Chart Elements
1. Hover over chart bars, lines, or points
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Element glows or brightens (glow effect visible)
   - ✅ Cursor changes to pointer
   - ✅ Animation is instant (<100ms)
3. Move mouse away → glow fades smoothly

---

## 3. Filter Change Animations

### Test 3.1: Filter Highlight
1. Open filter dropdown or chips (status, compression, etc.)
2. Change a filter value
3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Filter control briefly highlights (subtle pulse, 300ms)
   - ✅ Background color changes (rgba accent color)
   - ✅ Highlight fades after 300ms
4. If multiple filters changed, only changed one highlights

### Test 3.2: Content Fade During Filter Change
1. Change a filter that affects multiple sections
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Affected KPI cards fade out (150ms)
   - ✅ Charts fade out (150ms)
   - ✅ Skeleton loading appears (shimmer animation)
   - ✅ Content fades back in (200ms) when ready
   - ✅ Total time: <500ms perceived

### Test 3.3: Filter Responsiveness
1. Change filters rapidly (fast clicks)
2. **Verify**: No animation stutter or queue-up
   - Cancel in-flight animations gracefully
   - Only most recent filter change animates

---

## 4. Drilldown Zoom Feel

### Test 4.1: Clicking Chart Element
1. Find a chart with drillable elements (bar chart, pie chart)
2. Click on a chart bar/segment
3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Clicked element pulses (scales up briefly, 300ms)
   - ✅ Feels like "zooming in" not reloading
   - ✅ Breadcrumb appears above charts with animation
   - ✅ Dashboard content smoothly refocuses
4. Click another element → animation repeats

### Test 4.2: Breadcrumb Animation
1. After drilling down, breadcrumb should appear
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Breadcrumb slides in from left (smooth)
   - ✅ Breadcrumb text shows current level
   - ✅ Clicking breadcrumb level goes back smoothly
   - ✅ No jarring layout changes

---

## 5. Depth Level Transitions

### Test 5.1: Navigate Deeper (L1→L2→L3)
1. Dashboard shows Level 1 data
2. Click drilldown or navigate to Level 2
3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Level 1 dims (opacity 0.5, still visible)
   - ✅ Level 2 slides in from right (300ms, smooth)
   - ✅ Level 2 becomes active/opaque
   - ✅ Breadcrumb updates to show "Level 2"
4. Navigate to Level 3 → Level 2 dims, Level 3 slides in

### Test 5.2: Navigate Back
1. On Level 3, click back button or Level 1 breadcrumb
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Level 3 slides out smoothly
   - ✅ Levels 1-2 return to full opacity
   - ✅ Breadcrumb reflects current level
   - ✅ Smooth, not jarring

### Test 5.3: Depth Context
1. Navigate deep (Level 3+)
2. **Verify**: Context is never lost
   - Previous levels remain visible (dimmed)
   - Easy to see hierarchy
   - Going back is always possible

1. Click a button that opens a drawer (e.g., details, settings)
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Overlay dims smoothly (300ms, 0→0.4 opacity)
   - ✅ Drawer slides in from right (300ms, smooth)
   - ✅ Content inside drawer fades in (after slide completes, 200ms)
   - ✅ Can interact with drawer immediately

### Test 6.2: Closing Drawer
1. With drawer open, click close button or overlay
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Content fades out (200ms)
   - ✅ Drawer slides out right (250ms, smooth)
   - ✅ Overlay fades (250ms)
   - ✅ Drawer fully removed from DOM when animation done

### Test 6.3: Drawer Performance

## 9. Performance Targets

### Test 9.1: Frame Rate (60fps)
1. Open Dashboard Performance Monitor (Chrome DevTools → Rendering)
2. Trigger each animation:
   - Filter change
   - Chart fade
   - Drawer open/close
   - Drill into chart
3. **Verify**: All animations hit 60fps (no dropped frames)
   - No jank or stutter
   - Green bars in FPS meter
4. **On low-end device**: Test on older phone/tablet if possible
   - Animations should still be smooth (maybe 30-45fps acceptable)

### Test 9.2: Animation Duration <500ms
1. Time each animation:
   - Number count: 300-500ms ✓
   - Chart fade: 350ms total (150 + 200) ✓
   - Filter reaction: 350ms ✓
   - Drawer: 300ms in + 250ms out ✓
   - Depth slide: 300ms ✓
   - Mode switch: 300ms ✓
2. **Verify**: None exceed 500ms

### Test 9.3: GPU Acceleration
1. Open DevTools → Layers panel (if available)
2. Trigger animations
3. **Verify**: Animated elements are in separate layers
   - Stat values: content layer
   - Chart wrappers: opacity layer
   - Drawer: transform layer
   - No repaints, only composits

## Developer Notes

### Key Files
- `motion-choreography.js` — Main choreography system
- `motion.js` — Number animations & transitions
- `motion-integration.js` — Filter/HTMX orchestration
- `motion-choreography.css` — All animation definitions

### Performance Tuning
- Use DevTools Rendering tab to check 60fps target
- Check FPS meter during filter changes
- Look for dropped frames on low-end devices
- Profile with Chrome DevTools Performance tab

### Debugging
- Check `window.MotionChoreography` in console
- Monitor `will-change` properties (should auto-cleanup)
- Watch for animation class stacking
- Verify HTMX hooks fire (`htmx:afterSwap`)
