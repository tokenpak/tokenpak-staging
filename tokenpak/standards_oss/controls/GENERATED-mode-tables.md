# Mode tables (generated)

Generated from `controls/controls.yaml` and `profiles/authority/*.yaml`.
Regenerate with `python tools/standards.py generate`. Manual edits are overwritten and
fail `check-generated` in the meantime.

## Protected controls

These read identically under every authority profile. That is the design, not an omission.

| Control | Category | Executor | Authorizer | Independence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `publish.external-irreversible` | human-authorized | any | operator | independent |
| `legal.commitment` | non-delegable | operator | operator | independent |
| `finance.payment-authorize` | human-authorized | any | operator | independent |
| `finance.payment-destination-new` | non-delegable | operator | operator | independent |
| `data.disclose-external` | human-authorized | any | operator | separate-actor |
| `data.destroy` | human-authorized | any | operator | separate-actor |
| `access.credential-change` | human-authorized | any | operator | separate-actor |
| `access.key-custody-transfer` | non-delegable | operator | operator | independent |
| `access.grant-escalation` | human-authorized | any | operator | separate-actor |
| `record.history-alter` | human-authorized | any | operator | independent |
| `recovery.rollback` | human-authorized | any | operator | separate-actor |

Cell format: **authorizer / authorization type / independence requirement**.

Assurance level for every row: `procedural`. This corpus provides `declared` and
`validated` only — no row here is enforced at runtime (GOVERNANCE.md R23).
