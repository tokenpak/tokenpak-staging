"""Canonical on-disk path resolver for TokenPak.

Single source of truth for where TokenPak stores user state, system
state, and Pro daemon coordination files. New code MUST route through
this module rather than building ``Path.home() / ".tokenpak"`` ad hoc.

Resolution order:
    1. ``TOKENPAK_HOME`` env var (operator override, e.g. for sandboxes)
    2. whichever home already **holds state**, canonical preferred — so an
       existing install is never moved out from under its own readers by a
       directory that happened to get created
    3. ``~/.tpk/`` if it exists (canonical default)
    4. ``~/.tokenpak/`` if it exists (legacy fallback — zero-touch upgrade)
    5. ``~/.tpk/``

A *new* install always starts canonical: :func:`write_home` will not begin one
in the legacy directory. An *existing* legacy install keeps reading and writing
where it already lives until ``tokenpak config migrate`` moves it explicitly.

Layout:
    <home>/
        config.{json,yaml}      user config (config commands)
        license.json            license store (licensing module)
        debug.log               doctor/diagnostics log
        index.json              vault index
        templates/              user templates
        fleet.yaml              fleet manifest
        pinned_blocks.json      retain pins
        requests.jsonl          request log
        telemetry.db            telemetry store
        monitor.db              request ledger
        tunnels/                dashboard SSH tunnel state (control sockets, pids)
        companion/              companion subsystem state
        pro/                    Pro daemon coordination (sock-info, state)

The resolver is deliberately read-only — it does not create directories.
Callsites that need a directory must call ``ensure_home()`` (creates
``<home>/`` with mode 0700) or build their own ensure-step.
