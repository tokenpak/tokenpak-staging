"""TIP optimization fidelity policy — content preservation requirements.

``FidelityPolicy`` declares how aggressively the optimization layer may
alter request or context content for a given stage/route combination.

This is distinct from ``tokenpak.agent.compression.fidelity_tiers.FidelityTier``
(L0_RAW → L4_SUMMARY), which is a *compression level ladder* used by the
agent-side context manager. ``FidelityPolicy`` is a *proxy-side safety gate*
that constrains what the optimization pipeline may do to request bytes.
