# audit-docs.sh — detect doc drift in tokenpak/docs/
#
# Checks:
#   1. Case-insensitive duplicate filenames in docs/ (top-level .md files)
#      Redirect stubs (single-line "> This file has" pattern) are intentional
#      and exempt from this check.
#   2. Orphaned docs (docs/*.md not referenced in mkdocs.yml nav)
#      Redirect stubs are exempt from this check.
#   3. Root-level doc files that should be redirects:
#      TROUBLESHOOTING.md must not exist as a full doc (only as a redirect stub).
#
# Returns non-zero if any finding is detected.
# Used as a soft CI warning gate (continue-on-error in GitHub Actions).
#
# --release-gate: orphan-page findings (check 2) are surfaced as warnings but
# do not fail the gate. They are existing Medium documentation drift, tracked
# as known findings rather than classified as Critical or High.
# Duplicate-filename (check 1) and root-doc (check 3) findings still fail.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/audit-docs.sh [--release-gate] [docs-dir] [mkdocs-yml]
